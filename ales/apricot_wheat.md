## Equipment Notes

8 gallon kettle, BIAB method. It's close to the top, but no boil over. Be gentle not to spill!

1 gallon of water lost every hour at boil in my kettle.

## Brew day considerations

- Water: This is a brew in a bag with an 8gallon kettle. Pretty light
grain bill. I ran with 6.125gal for dough-in, but could run a little closer to 6.5 provided gentle stirring only.
- Strike temp is 152, but perform dough-in at 164.
